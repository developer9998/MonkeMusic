# MonkeMusic
## What is MonkeMusic?
MonkeMusic is a mod that lets you listen to your own music, it works with .OGG and .WAV files.

## How do you use MonkeMusic?
On your left palm there will be some text displaying what you're listening to and how far you're in.                  
Use your left controller's analog stick to switch songs, and change the time of the song by 10.                   
Also with your left controller, press X to pause/replay your song.                       
You can also use Q and E to switch songs and R to pause/replay if you're on PC.                  

## What are some of the cooler features?
 - Text on your left palm stating the current song's name and duration. (Mentioned.)
 - Keybind support both in VR and PC. (Mentioned.)
 - Use anywhere in Publics, Privates, Utilla Modded Lobbies, etc.

## How do you add custom songs?
Go to your Gorilla Tag folder, BepInEx\plugins\MonkeMusic\Music, and add any .OGG and/or .WAV files you want.

## What are some other information I should know?
 - This mod is NOT affiliated with MonkeTunes, as both mods act completely different. 
 - The .OGG files the mod uses will cause very minor freezing if the audio is about 35 seconds long.
 - This mod is still being worked on to have more features to simplify how it works.
